## The .pages.yml file

![Media](/media/screenshots/nextjs-settings-light@2x.png)

To configure Pages CMS you just need to add a `.pages.yml` file to the repository (and branch) that hosts your content and media. If this file isn't there when you open your repository/branch in Pages CMS, you will be presented with a link to add one via the Pages CMS interface.

You can have different configuration files on separate branches. The Pages CMS interface allows you to navigate between them (click on the name of repository at the top of the sidebar and then select the branch in the dropdown menu).

The `.pages.yml` file contains mainly 3 sections:

- **media**: the settings for media (images, videos, etc). [See the "Media" section below](#media).
- **content**: an array defining the content types. [See the "Content" section below](#content).
- **components**: an object defining reusable groups of fields. [See the "Components" section below](#components).

## Media

With media, you can configure how to handle files you want to upload, attach to or embed in your content. `media` can be a string, a single object or an array of objects depending on whether you want a single or multiple media folders and configurations.

![Media](/media/screenshots/nextjs-media-light@2x.png)

### Keys

| Key | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **`name`** | `string` | **Required if media is an array. Must be unique across the media array**. Machine name for the media entry. |
| **`label`** | `string` | Display name for the media. This will be displayed in the main menu. |
| **`input`** | `string` | The path to the media folder relative to the root of the repo (e.g. `src/files/media`). This path is what allows us to find the files in Pages CMS to manage content and media. |
| **`output`** | `string` | The path to the media folder relative to the root of the website (e.g. `files/media`). This path will prefix all media saved in our content, which will be used by your static site generator. |
| **`path`** | `string` | The default path to present the user (e.g. when opening the media browser on an [Image Field](/docs/configuration/image-field)). |
| **`extensions`** | `array` | An array of file extensions (strings) that should be displayed (e.g., `[png, jpg]`). If provided, any file with an extension not included in this list will not be shown to the user. |
| **`categories`** | `array` | An array of category names (strings) to allow specific file types: `image` (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `svg`, `bmp`, `tif`, `tiff`), `document` (`pdf`, `doc`, `docx`, `ppt`, `pptx`, `vxls`, `xlsx`, `txt`, `rtf`), `video` (`mp4`, `avi`, `mov`, `wmv`, `flv`), `audio` (`mp3`, `wav`, `aac`, `ogg`, `flac`) and `compressed` (`zip`, `rar`, `7z`, `tar`, `gz`, `tgz`). If both `extensions` and `categories` are provided, `categories` might be combined or `extensions` might take precedence depending on the field. |

If `media` is set to a `string`, it is equivalent to settings both `media.input` and `media.output` to that value, prefixed with `/` for `media.output`.

For example, `media: files/media` would be equivalent to:

```yaml
media:
  input: files/media
  output: /files/media
```

If we want to define multiple media configurations, we can use an array (see examples below).

### Examples

Let's assume the content for my website is at the root of my repo:

```yaml
media: files/media
```

Now, if the content for this website was in a `src/` subfolder, it could look like this:

```yaml
media:
  input: src/media
  output: media
```

Let's assume now that I'm hosting my website in a subfolder (e.g. hosted at `http://example.com/my-website/`), I may want to do the following:

```yaml
media:
  input: src/media
  output: /my-website/media
```

Now, if I want to use a `files/documents` folder only for document uploads (e.g. pdf, doc, ppt) and another `images` folder with my photos that must be in `.png` or `.webp` formats, we could do the following:

```yaml
media:
  - name: files
    label: Files
    input: files/documents
    output: /files/documents
    categories: [ document ]
  - name: images # Note: 'name' key is required here
    label: Images
    input: images
    output: /images
    extensions: [ png, webp ]
```

## Content

Content managed by the users: collections (e.g. blog posts) and file types (e.g. the home page). The `content` key should be set as an array of content entries.

![Collection view](/media/screenshots/nextjs-collection-light@2x.png)

### Keys

Each content entry can define the following keys:

| Key | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **`name`** | `string` | **Required and must be unique across the content array**. Machine name for the content entry. |
| **`label`** | `string` | Display name for the collection or single file. This will be displayed in the main menu. |
| **`type`**| `string` | **Required**. `collection` or `file`, depending on whether the content entry is a collection of files with an identical schema (e.g. blog posts) or a single file (e.g. home page). |
| **`path`** | `string` | **Required**. Path to the folder where the files are stored if it's a collection (e.g. `path: src/posts`, otherwise the path to the single file (e.g. `path: src/index.md`). |
| **`fields`** | `string` | The list of fields defining the schema of the content entry (e.g. title, date, author, body, etc). [See the "Fields" section below](#fields). |
| **`filename`** | `string` | The pattern to generate the filename when creating a new file. This also defines how files are looked up. You can use the value of any field (e.g. `{{fields.title}}`) including nested values (e.g. `{{fields.tags[0].label}}`). You can also use a few date tokens (`{year}`, `{month}`, `{day}`) and time (`{hour}`, `{minute}`, `{second}`) and `{primary}` for the primary field as defined in the `view` key. By default this is set to `'{year}-{month}-{day}-{primary}.md'`. |
| **`exclude`** | `array` | An array of files to exclude from the collection (e.g. `[ README.md ]`). This is only valid for collections.
| **`view`** | `object` | **Only valid for collections**. This object defines the various options for the collection view; visible fields, sorting options and defaults, fields indexed for the search... [See the "View" section below](#view). |
| **`format`** | `string` | The format of the file, used to set up the editor to edit the content: `yaml-frontmatter`, `json-frontmatter`, `toml-frontmatter`, `yaml`, `json`, `toml`, `datagrid`, `code` or `raw`. It defaults to `yaml-frontmatter`. |
| **`subfolders`** | `boolean` | Whether or not the collection should display subfolders. Default to `true`. Set to `false` if you want to force the collection of files to be "flat". |

### Examples

Let's assume we have a simple collection of blog posts all saved in the `src/_posts` folder:

```yaml
content:
  - name: posts
    label: Posts
    path: src/_posts
    type: collection
    fields:
      # ... fields defined here ...
  - name: authors
    label: Authors
    path: src/_data/authors.json
    type: file
    fields:
      # ... fields defined here ...
```

### View

The `view` object is only valid for `type: collection` content entries. It defines the configuration for the collection view, aka the page that lists the entries for a collection which is accessed from the main menu under a specific repo/branch (e.g. `https://app.pagescms.org/pages-cms/template-nextjs/content/posts/`).

#### Keys

| Key | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **`fields`** | `array` | List of the fields to be displayed in the collection view (e.g. `fields: [ title, published, author ]`). This can include nested fields and values (e.g. `fields: [ title, published, "tags[0]", author.name ]`). If not defined, it defaults to just the primary field (see below). The order of the fields is kept in the collection view. |
| **`primary`** | `string` | The name of the field that should be used as the primary field (e.g. `primary: title`). If undefined, it will be set to the `title` field if it exists, otherwise the first field define in the content entry (e.g. `content.posts.fields[0].name`). |
| **`sort`** | `array` | The list of fields that the collection can be sorted by (e.g. `sort: [ date, title ]`). By default, it is set to the date (if any) and the primary field. |
| **`search`** | `array` | The list of fields that should be indexed for search. By default, all fields are indexed. |
| **`default`** | `object` | Define the default values for search and sorting: `{ search: 'My keywords', sort: title, order: asc }`). `default.order` can be `asc` or `desc`. By default, `default.search` is empty, `default.sort` is the first field in the `sort` array and `default.order` is set to `desc`. |
| **`layout`** | `string` | Controls the visual layout of the collection view, either `list` (default) or `tree` for a collapsible tree view.
| **`node`**   | `string` or `object` | If a `string`, it will be treated as the value for `node.filename`. If an object, it can have 2 attributes: `filename` for the filename of the nodes (e.g. `index.md`) and `hideDirs` (can be `all`, `nodes` or `others` to hide either all folders, only node folders or folders other than the nodes'). A node is typically a nested file in a subfolder (e.g. `folder/subfolder/index.md`) that will show up as if it were in its parent folder (e.g. `folder/`) and act as the parent of all of its siblings in the subfolder. It is useful either if entries in your collection are nested (e.g. `2025-01-01-my-post/index.md`) or if you want to show a tree layout with nodes as parents of the subfolders' entries. |

#### Examples

Assuming you have a `date` field and `title` is the primary field, your default configuration would look like:

```yaml
view:
  fields: [ title ]
  primary: title
  sort: [ date, title ]
  default:
    search: ''
    sort: title
    order: desc
```

This would display the title of each post and sort them by title in descendant order (start with special characters and numbers, all the way to `z`).

Let's assume we also have the following:

- `published`, a boolean that defines whether or not the post is published,
- `author`, a string set to the name of the author.

Let's set the view to only display the posts from `Patricia`, display title, date and the published state with the newer posts first:

```yaml
view:
  fields: [ title, date, published ] # title is the first entry and thus will be set to primary
  sort: [ date, title, published ]
  default:
    search: 'author:Patricia'
    sort: date
    order: desc
```

The `author:Patricia` syntax [comes from lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html#fields), the search library used by Pages CMS under the hood. Other syntax will work too (wildcards, boosts, fuzzy matches and term presence).

If I wanted to show a tree view of my collection, with some nodes:

```yaml
view:
  layout: tree
  node:
    filename: index.md
    hideDirs: all # This will hide all subfolders, even if they do not contain a node
```

## Components

Components allow you to define reusable groups of fields or field configurations. They act like templates that can be referenced within your content entries.

Components are defined under a top-level `components` key in your `.pages.yml` file. This key holds an *object* where each key is a unique component name, and the value is the component definition. A component definition follows the same structure as a standard [Field definition](#fields) but without the `name` key.

### Component Definition Keys

The keys used to define a component are the same as those used for [Fields](#fields), **except** the `name` key (which is defined by the key in the `components` object).

| Key | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **`label`** | `string` | Display name for the component. Primarily used for documentation or if referenced directly in certain UI contexts. |
| **`type`** | `string` | The underlying base type of the component (e.g., `object`, `text`, `image`). Often `object` when grouping fields. If undefined but `fields` is present, defaults to `object`. |
| **`fields`** | `array` | If `type` is `object`, this lists the fields contained within this component. These follow the standard [Field](#fields) definition structure. |
| **`component`** | `string` | Allows a component to inherit from *another* component. The value should be the name (key) of the component to inherit from. Properties from the inheriting component will override the base component. |
| ... | ... | Other standard field keys like `description`, `default`, `list`, `hidden`, `required`, `pattern`, `options` can be used to configure the component itself. |

### Examples

Here's an example defining two components: a `hero` component with a headline and cover image, and a simple `email` component defining a reusable string field with pattern validation.

```yaml
components:
  hero: # 'hero' is the component name/key
    label: Hero Section
    type: object
    fields:
      - name: headline
        label: Headline
        type: text
        required: true
      - name: cover
        label: Cover Image
        type: image
  email: # 'email' is the component name/key
    label: Email Address
    type: string
    pattern:
      regex: '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
      message: 'This must be a valid email address (e.g. hello@example.com).'
```

These components can then be referenced by their name using the `component` key within the `fields` definition of your content types or even within other components.

## Fields

Fields define the structure and data types for your content entries or [components](#components).

### Keys

| Key | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **`name`** | `string` | **Required** (unless defining a component directly under the `components` key) **and must be unique within its parent fields array**. Machine name for the field. **`body` is reserved for the main content of the file when dealing with a frontmatter format** (e.g., YAML frontmatter). |
| **`label`** | `string` | Display name for the field. This is what is displayed in the edit form. If omitted, the `name` is used. |
| **`description`** | `string` | Help text displayed below the field in the form. |
| **`type`** | `string` | Defines the type of field. Can be a single type name: **[block](/docs/configuration/block-field)**, **[boolean](/docs/configuration/boolean-field)**, **[code](/docs/configuration/code-field)**, **[date](/docs/configuration/date-field)**, **[file](/docs/configuration/file-field)**, **[image](/docs/configuration/image-field)**, **[number](/docs/configuration/number-field)**, **[object](/docs/configuration/object-field)**, **[reference](/docs/configuration/reference-field)**, **[rich-text](/docs/configuration/rich-text-field)**, **[select](/docs/configuration/select-field)**, **[string](/docs/configuration/string-field)**, **[text](/docs/configuration/text-field)** or **[uuid](/docs/configuration/uuid-field)**. If undefined, it defaults to `text` unless `fields` is defined (then it defaults to `object`). |
| **`component`** | `string` | Allows a field to inherit its properties (like `type`, `label`, nested `fields`, `options`, etc.) from a defined [Component](#components). The value should be the name (key) of the component to inherit from. Properties defined directly on the field (like `name`, `label`, `required`) will override those inherited from the component. The `type` inherited from the component takes precedence over any `type` defined on the field itself. |
| **`default`** | (any) | Default value for the field when a new entry is created. |
| **`list`** | `boolean` or `object` | If truthy, the field is an array of values (of the type defined for the field). [See the "List" section below](#list). |
| **`hidden`** | `boolean` | If `true`, the field will not be displayed in the form but will be saved. It is usually used with `default` to set a required field that shouldn't be edited by users, like for example the language of a post (`lang: en-US`). |
| **`required`** | `boolean` | If `true`, the field can't be empty. |
| **`pattern`** | `string` or `object` | A regular expression to validate the field. A custom message for the error can be provided by defining an object with `regex` and `message` attributes (e.g. `pattern: { message: 'This must be a valid email address (e.g. hello@example.com).', regex: '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$' }`) |
| **`fields`** | `array` | **Only valid for object fields**. List of the fields in that object. |
| **`options`** | `object` | Options for that field. Refer to the field specific details below. |

### List

Any field with a truthy `list` key will be stored as an array of that field type. For example:

```yaml
- name: images
  label: Images
  type: image
  list: true
```

Will allow the user to save multiple image paths:

```yaml
images:
  - media/image-1.png
  - media/image-2.png
```

`list` can be an object with `min`, `max`, `default` and `collapsible` keys. `min` and `max` define the minimum and maximum number of entries in the array. For example:

```yaml
- name: tags
  label: Tags
  type: string
  list:
    min: 1 # Must have at least one tag
    max: 5 # Can have up to five tags
    default: [news] # Default value when creating new entry
```

This will force the user to enter at least 1 tag and at most 5.

By default, list entries are collapsible. You can disable this behavior by setting `collapsible` to `false`:

```yaml
- name: tags
  label: Tags
  type: string
  list:
    collapsible: false
```

You can also configure the collapsible behavior by setting `collapsible` to an object with `collapsed` and `summary` properties:

```yaml
- name: sections
  label: Sections
  type: object
  list:
    collapsible:
      collapsed: true # Default collapsed state
      summary: "{title} ({index})" # Template string using field values and {index}
```

The `summary` template string can use:
- Field values using `{fields.fieldName}` syntax
- The index of the item using `{index}`

Certain fields (e.g. the [image field](/docs/configuration/image-field)) implement their own list logic for handling multiple elements with the `mutliple` option. You can use either one approach, both result in an array of values.

## Settings

This allows you to apply global settings within this repository and branch.

### Keys

| Key   | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| :---- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hide`  | `boolean` | If set to `true`, the "Settings" link/page will be hidden in the Pages CMS UI. |
| `content` | `object`  | An object containing settings specifically related to content handling. |
| `content.merge` | `object`  | Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, when saving an existing content entry, the submitted fields will be merged with the fields already present in the file. Fields present only in the file will be preserved. Fields present in both will take the value from the submitted form. If `false`, the file content will be completely overwritten with the submitted form data (after processing according to the schema). This is helpful if you want to expose only parts of your file for editing. |

### Examples

To hide the settings editor and enable the content merge behavior:

```yaml
settings:
  hide: true
  content:
    merge: true
```

To just enable the content merge behavior:

```yaml
settings:
  content:
    merge: true
```
